The Pythagorean equation is $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Solving the Pythagorean equation for $a$ would be:
$$a=\sqrt{c^2-b^2}$$

The equation for integration by parts is:

$$\int u dv = uv - \int v du$$

This is a Greek letter $\varepsilon$.

The summation formula is: $\sum_{i=1}^n i= \frac{n(n+1)}{n}$

The linear regression model formula is: $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*X_i + \dots +\beta_n * X_n  + \upmu $$
